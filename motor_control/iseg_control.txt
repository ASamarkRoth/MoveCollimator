iseg crate we have is rather old, not in production anymore. 

The crate comes with the right most module with a "can bus" and it is via this it can be controlled.

A connection between the can-bus and a computer is achieved with the dsub9 connector (looks like VGA). To connect to computer a dsb9 <-> usb adapter is to be preferred (according to iseg). Do we have anyone of those in-house?
	Should be included in mail from iseg ...
