The drawings for the Lycca mount scanner is found in folder figs_and_draws

Description from DR:
Here are four drawings (pdf, 1:1) for the "outer part" of the
Scanner. There are three 10-mm thick disks, 60 cm (!) in diameter:

- a base made of aluminum, with threads for 4mm-pins keeping the
horizontal absorbers and distance pieces in place. 
	Why do we keep the distance pieces in place?
		Since it should be portable. Enabled with screws.

- the bottom piece, hard plastic or - visualisation!? - plexiglas.
This keeps the 12 LYCCA modules in place around the inner octagon.
Their shape should be milled away 5mm out of the total 10-mm
thickness of that piece (drawn in dark green).

- a cover sheet, plastic again.

Bottom and top need to be kept at a vertical distance of 56 mm
(LYCCA module: 61 mm in height, minus the 5 mm milling, see above).
Therefore, we need 12 pieces of (cylindrical) distance "pins",
56mm in height, 12 mm in diameter, and with M6 threads top and bottom.
(The "blue" rings in the other drawings indicate their positions.)

The four preamplifer boxes are only 40 mm in height, thus we need
4 pieces (plastic/plexi) of blocks of 60mm x 60mm x 16mm.
	The preamplifier boxes are not part of the drawing. They will fill the open areas and protrude out from the structure. 

Presumably, any workshop should be able to produce those macroscopic
pieces; uncertainties of 0.1 mm are for sure sufficient, we can
probably even live with 0.2 mm .

The only CRITICAL thing, as that couples to the other pieces, are the positions and verticality of
the 4-mm threads in the aluminum base.

The company you asked via Nicolai is probably a straight possibility.

In fact, once we have those pieces (quickly, since rather easy),
we/you ;-) can prepare the surrounding LYCCA-part of the scatterer
(=PET scanner!).
