In this document we structure Guillem's project work. 

Overall: Development of the Lund germanium detector scanning system and characterisation of a square type HPGe crystal

Objectives:

1. Develop an xy-positioning system
	Structure
	Components

2. Create a 3D-model of the finished/complete scanning system
	Simulate load

3. Characterisation of the Compex prototype crystal with a simple scanning system
	Verification of Canberra measurements
		Resolution for Co-60, Co-57(, Fe-55) and Cs-137
		Peak symmetry, FWTM/FWHM
		Peak to Compton ratio
		Efficiency
	Examine properties of the conventional HPGe crystal scanning system
		Determine scintillator efficiencies
		What is the expected count rate for the finished system? Examine:
			With collimator
			Just detectors
	Characterise the crystal with a simple scanning
		Determine the above properties for:
			x,y = 4*corner + middle
			z = optional
		Analyse
	Extra: Measure crystal capacitance vs. voltage
		Determine dopant concentration!?
