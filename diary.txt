In this document events that have occurred in the use Compex components should be written down.

Compex prototype:
26/01: First HV ramp up, ~500 V per 2 min.
	Signals, well shaped, are there without source
	Co-60 source added - weirdly shaped signals and spectrum
27/01: Change of source to Cs-137 ~10 kBq
	Nice looking spectrum obtained over the weekend
30/01: Change of scale on oscilloscope -> the y-position of the signal shifts, i.e. we have an offset. This was not the case after first ramp up!
	Also, mistakenly ramped up the voltage to max (forgot to rotate switch back). But the signal shape still looked good.
03/02: Change of the shaper, new measurements must be performed. Performed three sets of measurements with source of 60 and 57 cobalt and 137 cesium.
	Measurement of the background has been started and will be on through the weekend.
06/02: Added a bunch of new modules to get some coincidences. The whole scheme will be drawn in the Latex file as soon as I can.
	This far, we have the data for 60 and 57 cobalt, 137 cesium and the background. I will start a measurement with a 55 iron source for the night.
	Worked on coincidences, the whole setup is now working (NIM to TTL was not working correctly) and I will try to get some data tomorrow.
07/02: First data with the whole coincidence setup are now in the "measurement" folder but is the setup really working ?
	Indeed, too much noise on the final coincidence spectrum. Noise may come from the scintillators: performed a coincidence measurement shielding the scintillators and still noise.
	Need to determine exactly how we expect the coincidence spectrum to look like so that we can pursue further.
	Had to do a new calibration (60 cobalt) while we added gain in order to see coincidences.
	The setup changed a little: had to remove one of the "collimation bricks" of lead to get a decent count rate and thus the distance from the source to the top of the crystal changed (-70mm total).
