In this document events that have occurred in the use Compex components should be written down.

Compex prototype:
26/1: First HV ramp up, ~500 V per 2 min.
	Signals, well shaped, are there without source
	Co-60 source added - weirdly shaped signals and spectrum
27/1: Change of source to Cs-137 ~10 kBq
	Nice looking spectrum obtained over the weekend
30/1: Change of scale on oscilloscope -> the y-position of the signal shifts, i.e. we have an offset. This was not the case after first ramp up!
	Also, mistakenly ramped up the voltage to max (forgot to rotate switch back). But the signal shape still looked good.
