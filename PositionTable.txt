What positioning table?
Position sensitivity: 
	Min Achievable Incremental Movement: ?

Range - x,y = 120 mm
Weight stability and robustness: collimator + lock ~ 25 kg
	Vertical load capacity: 
	Horizontal load capacity: 
Geometry
	Hole
	Collimator as close as possible to the crystal
Actuator - stepper motor controller

Linear unit on top of linear unit seems nice. ~ 20000 kr, but hole?


Dewar upside down - double trouble (leak!)

What about moving the dewar+crystal? Roughly around the same weight, but big!

Exists larger ones with a big hole. But can we scan the whole thing? 

THE ONE
4 surrounding linear units with two motors, interesting!
	Two linear units on bottom to position x with one motor controlling both
	Two linear units on top to position y with one motor controlling both
	Bearings with sliding cylinders is an option to separate much of the load from the shaft/linear unit and avoid additional motors such as 2 extra linear units
	What is the effect on the precision if the two are connected?
	Need to account for the dimensions of the absorbers, lycca crystals etc. for the supporting structure
	Integrate lycca crystals within the hole of the positioning table?


Specify number of scanning points -> precision, step length ...
So we want to study the properties of the crystal, especially those in the corners. It would be preferably to have multiple points here -> stepsize towards 2 mm.
Other than that it doesn't need to be very precise since there are too many uncertainties:
	Crystal + crystat
	Collimator on plate
	Size of beam is unclear!? (5 cm from the collimator exit -> beam diameter = 2 mm)
	Tilting angle of the table/positioning system, it gives another uncertainty! How can you measure the angle? Water drop thingy?
	
Example: Start 0.5 cm from side and move with 1 cm to other side 5x5 points in x-y plane.

Phone call:
	Push ~30 kg

Guillem, contact PhysikInstrumente (this company seems experienced, big, short notice!!):
What was written to PI:
We want to scan a germanium crystal of surface 120mm*120mm with a
colliding beam coming from above the surface of the crystal. We thus are
looking for a setup that could scan the whole surface of that crystal with
a precision of roughly 0.1mm, carrying a maximum weight of 30kg while the
beam is focused and surrounded by lead and tungsten. The whole setup should
be motorized so that we can program the position where we want the beam to
collide with the crystal to study it and will be placed above the crystal
and its cryostat, around 1m from the ground.
Call: Does not exist a finished product, tailor made? Perhaps weight a limitation. 

Califa+Alex:
	PROBLEMS WITH NOISE ORIGINATING FROM THE MOTORS. 
	Motors are magnetically controlled.
	Proposition: pneumatic driven system
	Newmark was the company.
