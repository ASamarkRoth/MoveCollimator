What positioning table?
Position sensitivity: 
	Min Achievable Incremental Movement: ?

Range - x,y = 120 mm
Weight stability and robustness: collimator + lock ~ 25 kg
	Vertical load capacity: 
	Horizontal load capacity: 
Geometry
	Hole
	Collimator as close as possible to the crystal
Actuator - stepper motor controller

Linear unit on top of linear unit seems nice. ~ 20000 kr, but hole?


Dewar upside down - double trouble (leak!)

What about moving the dewar+crystal? Roughly around the same weight, but big!

Exists larger ones with a big hole. But can we scan the whole thing? 

THE ONE
4 surrounding linear units with two motors, interesting!
	Two linear units on bottom to position x with one motor controlling both
	Two linear units on top to position y with one motor controlling both

Specify number of scanning points -> precision, step length ...
