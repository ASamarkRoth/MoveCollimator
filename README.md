This repository holds all the information regarding the development and instructions of the Lund HPGe Scanning System. 

The _How to_ set up the system description is presented in `setting_up.pdf`. 

The software to run the scanning system can be found in `atlundiumberry/`. 
The program should be run through the ScanningComputer which comprise the Raspberry Pi and Gertbot and is able to control the movement of the collimator.
