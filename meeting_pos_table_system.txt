Prio:
	Length linear units 
	Gertbot remote shutdown!


Meeting concerning: proposal of positioning system and structure in its whole

Positioning system: 

Aratron - 2 linear units, 1 linear railway + wagon
1st KK5002C-250A1-F3S0
Pris: 4650:-/st)
1st KK6005C-400A1-F3S0
	This needs to be 600!!!!
Pris: 6650:-/st)
Flygfrakt 1200:- från Taiwan
1st Wagon HGH15CAZ0C Pris: 355:-/st
	HGW15CC ? What is rest?
	C = Heavy load, A = mount from top, missing 1 for nbr. blocks per rail, ...
1st railway/guide HGR15 L=340 E= 20/20 Pris 208:-/st
1st kapkostnad 60:-

Compotech - 2 stepper motors (NEMA 17):
17H261-02S/D (61mm lång, 1,2A per fas (motor drar då max ~1,8A totalt, ger ca 0,5Nm vid låga varvtal)):             190kr/st exkl. moms
	Can we shut-down the motors remotely?

Gertbot - motor control board 
Rs-online: 600 kr
	Power supply!?
		Can you make this remote controlled?

Raspberry pie 3 - Computer
Rs-online: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B SBC: 300 kr
	Remote controlled via ethernet!
	It goes on the Gertbot!

Position system table:
	> 600x600: determine!
	Material = Al?
	A center hole: ~130x130 (some margins?)
	4 support legs which should be fixed at the height adjustable table and this table
		Height= 90? Cf. 86 mm of height of Lycca holder!
		How to fix these? Screw/mill?
		Material = Al?
	On plate:
		Drill holes for screws of linear units and railway
		Do we want threads or holes going through with nubs?
			M4?
	Last stage: fix linear units!
	Where to put gertbot+raspberry pie?
		How long cables?
		Gather cables for moving motor: cable binders?
		

Height adjustable table:
Gigant - tailor made version:
	Optimised dimensions (800x800) with made hole
	Standardhöjd 675-1125 + skivtjocklek 40 mm.
	We should fix:
		Lycca Al base
		Support legs for position system table
		What plate material? Possible to drill or mill ourself?
		We should be able to drill and fix stuff on this!?
	Double check - back support board!
	Hand-driven (handle), do we want this?


Collimator arm:
	Made some calculations and simulations:
	Simulation Fusion 360: 
		Aluminum arm would bend at maximum 0.27mm (on the edge of the arm platform) and around 0.08mm on the angle that makes the arm with the horizontal.
		Using steel, the maximum bend would be 0.1mm (stainless steel, 0.09 for steel) and on the angle, around 0.025 (stainless steel, 0.02 for steel).
	A deflection of 0.1 mm at the end of the arm platform -> emission angle = 1e-3 radians -> 0.02 mm deflection after 20 mm trajectory
		I.e. does not affect very much!!!!
	10 mm height frame soldered to the arm base plate to keep the collimator in place.
