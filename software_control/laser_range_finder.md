Hi!

My name is Anton Såmark-Roth and I am a PhD student at Lund University, Sweden. We are building a scanning system where we want to measure distances typically 10 cm with accuracies of 0.1 mm. It is important that it is small (dimensions ~ 3x3x3 cm^3) and light weight. It would also be great if one can connect it to a linux computer and read data. 

Do you have any suggested products or solutions for that? 

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,
Anton Såmark-Roth
