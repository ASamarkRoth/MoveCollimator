iseg crate we have is rather old, not in production anymore. 

The crate comes with the right most module with a "can bus" and it is via this it can be controlled.

A connection between the can-bus and a computer is achieved with the dsub9 connector (looks like VGA). To connect to computer a dsb9 <-> usb adapter is to be preferred (according to iseg). Do we have anyone of those in-house?
	Should be included in mail from iseg ...

Ordered dsb9-usb connector, supposed to arrive Thursday 23/3!
The invoice/order is available in the map orders.
These items have arrived. However, a dsb9 connector extender is needed. Possibly also a usb-usb extender in order to put the laptop at a desired place.

This is essential in the installation process: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXT10xaJ0V8>
