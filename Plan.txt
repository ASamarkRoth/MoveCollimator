Plan for lp1 scanning system. 

What to do?

Lab
	Assemble and set up equipment

Scanning system
	
	Determine complete set up
		z-placement and movement
		What positioning table?
			Position sensitivity
			Range
			Weight stability and robustness
			Geometry (integrated hole, somehow)

	Position sensitive table
		Assemble
		Program

	Compex-crystal
		Set up, connect
		Verify Canberra measurements
			Energy resolution
			Trapping
		Acquaintance - How to treat and work with it?

	Lycca-crystals
		Set up, connect
		Characterise
			Efficiency
			Timing
	
	Student lab crystals
		Characterise
			Geant4 vs. Meas. and Physics model
		
	Complete scanning system
		DAQ - prepare scanning method
			Coincidence
			Gate?
		Data analysis
			Position vs. response
			Pulse shapes
		Geant4 simulation
			Prediction
			Comparison
