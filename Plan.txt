Plan for lp1 scanning system. 

What to do?

To do:
	What step motors and controllers should we purchase?
		Evaluate options obtained from rs-online and Compotech (CNC Linear comp.)
		Study motor housing alternatives from SKS
		Aratron and Compotech alternatives
	Determine height adjustable table
		What about the blue table?
			Drill hole possible?
			Height interval = ? (important if dewar min height is large)
		Is it necessary that the 2nd table is height adjustable?
	Specify collimator arm (not prioritised):
		Dimensions and material
		Further simulations should be done
		Talk to Mikael Ekholm and order from work shop at BMC!?
	Determine height adjustable platform for dewar, labjack or lyftbord
		Further investigations needed

	Guillem project -> scan the Compex prototype
	Is 24V and 48V DC available? (Pavel)
	Calculate expected lifetimes for the linear units according to the formulas in the brochures
	
	Program and configure voltage-ramp control

	Think about the collimator arm, how should it look like ? Make some drawings with different configurations ?
	Same thing for the top table, especially the four feet of the table.

	LYCCA:
		We need screws, determine which ones and how many
		Find rods, determine length
		Build Lycca ring
		Measure and evaluate the crystals. How?
	
	Purchase gamma sources:

	For future measurements:
		Measure spectroscopic features over time...
		Measure for different bias HV!





Lab
	Assemble and set up equipment

Scanning system
	
	Determine complete set up
		z-placement and movement
		What positioning table?
			Position sensitivity
			Range
			Weight stability and robustness
			Geometry (integrated hole, somehow)

	Position sensitive table
		Assemble
		Program

	Compex-crystal
		Set up, connect
		Verify Canberra measurements
			Energy resolution
			Trapping
		Acquaintance - How to treat and work with it?

	Lycca-crystals
		Set up, connect
		Characterise
			Efficiency
			Timing
	
	Student lab crystals
		Characterise
			Geant4 vs. Meas. and Physics model
		
	Complete scanning system
		DAQ - prepare scanning method
			Coincidence
			Gate?
		Data analysis
			Position vs. response
			Pulse shapes
		Geant4 simulation
			Prediction
			Comparison
		
Finished:
	Decide the linear units and the LM guide
		Hear from PI?
			Yeah 2 proposals, but it looked expensive!
		How do we fix the linear units?
			Guillem made calculations of this and came to a package solution. Should be verified before order. 
	Determine the collimator arm
		This can be made in the workshop, contact is Mikael Ekholm. Provide a simple drawing.
		The distance going down is limited by the height of the linear units + wagon stuff
	Contact another firm (than SveMek) for Lycca holder
		SveMek seems nice here!
		Order made!
	Drawings are nice: need to see the complete system!
	3D drawing of the scanning system
	Second table : plate on top is fine, drawing is done.
	Watch "how to" videos from Canberra
	Get drawings from producers after an offer/contract
		Guillem has fixed this!


	VERY IMPORTANT:
	Plan in detail everything for 2nd
