Plan for lp1 scanning system. 

What to do?

Lab
	Assemble and set up equipment

Scanning system
	
	Determine complete set up
		z-placement and movement
		What positioning table?
			Position sensitivity
			Range
			Weight stability and robustness
			Geometry (integrated hole, somehow)

	Position sensitive table
		Assemble
		Program

	Compex-crystal
		Set up, connect
		Verify Canberra measurements
			Energy resolution
			Trapping
		Acquaintance - How to treat and work with it?

	Lycca-crystals
		Set up, connect
		Characterise
			Efficiency
			Timing
	
	Student lab crystals
		Characterise
			Geant4 vs. Meas. and Physics model
		
	Complete scanning system
		DAQ - prepare scanning method
			Coincidence
			Gate?
		Data analysis
			Position vs. response
			Pulse shapes
		Geant4 simulation
			Prediction
			Comparison
		

To do:
	Drawings are nbr 1 priority: need to see the complete system!
	3D drawing of the scanning system
		Get drawings from producers
	Contact another firm (than SveMek) for Lycca holder
	Decide the linear units and the LM guide
		Determine the collimator arm
		Hear from PI?
		How do we fix the linear units?
	Contact Habo about table legs solution.
