Plan for lp1 scanning system. 

What to do?

Lab
	Assemble and set up equipment

Scanning system
	
	Determine complete set up
		z-placement and movement
		What positioning table?
			Position sensitivity
			Range
			Weight stability and robustness
			Geometry (integrated hole, somehow)

	Position sensitive table
		Assemble
		Program

	Compex-crystal
		Set up, connect
		Verify Canberra measurements
			Energy resolution
			Trapping
		Acquaintance - How to treat and work with it?

	Lycca-crystals
		Set up, connect
		Characterise
			Efficiency
			Timing
	
	Student lab crystals
		Characterise
			Geant4 vs. Meas. and Physics model
		
	Complete scanning system
		DAQ - prepare scanning method
			Coincidence
			Gate?
		Data analysis
			Position vs. response
			Pulse shapes
		Geant4 simulation
			Prediction
			Comparison
		
Finished:
	Decide the linear units and the LM guide
		Hear from PI?
			Yeah 2 proposals, but it looked expensive!
		How do we fix the linear units?
			Guillem made calculations of this and came to a package solution. Should be verified before order. 
	Determine the collimator arm
		This can be made in the workshop, contact is Mikael Ekholm. Provide a simple drawing.
		The distance going down is limited by the height of the linear units + wagon stuff
	Contact another firm (than SveMek) for Lycca holder
		SveMek seems nice here!
	Drawings are nice: need to see the complete system!
	3D drawing of the scanning system
	Second table : plate on top is fine, drawing is done.
	Watch "how to" videos from Canberra

To do:
		Get drawings from producers after an offer/contract
	What step motors should we purchase?

	Determine height adjustable table
		Is it necessary that the 2nd table is height adjustable?

	Height adjustable platform for dewar
